## Problem
In recents years vinyl records have dramatically increased in popularity with a 25 year high in sales reached in 2016 - even outselling digital music. Many new releases are available on vinyl and even older releases are now also being reissued on vinyl. With the increased popularity of vinyl and related events such as Record Store Day and record fairs, there is a greater demand for online shopfronts to facilitate the buying and selling of new, used and collectible records. With the exception of large, international sites such as Discogs, or non-specialist sites such as eBay there is little in the way of sites that focus on the secondhand and collectible record trade.

## Solution
Develop a two-sided marketplace rails application to enable people to buy and sell secondhand vinyl records.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram
During development I revised the ERD by removing several models and instead, displaying data from the Discogs API and only saving the necessary data from API calls.

- [ERD v2](https://dbdesigner.net/designer/schema/122698)

### Design
I began the design process by exploring online music stores to gain inspiration and ideas about how to present content. I also used this time to see what these sites are doing that could be improved in Long Play Records.

- [Amoeba Music](http://www.amoeba.com)
- [Banquet Records](https://www.banquetrecords.com)
- [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com)
- [Boomkat Records](https://boomkat.com)
- [InterPunk](http://www.interpunk.com)
- [Red Eye Records](https://www.redeye.com.au)

Most sites that I reviewed had a dated and chaotic design that was distracting and had no clear path for the site's visitors.

I draw inspiration in my designs from [Banquet Records](https://www.banquetrecords.com) and in particular [Boomkat records](https://boomkat.com) which has a simple, understated and modern design. Boomkat's user experience is intuitive as the content is displayed progressively. The site does not overwhelm the visitor with content but at the same time was able to provide comprehensive information for each item.

I wanted to create an experience that featured the cover art to gain the visitor's attention. I wanted the design to be reminiscent of a record store with the walls lined with records
My goal was to design and build a portfolio site that was striking, unique and memorable while still being simple and minimal in design. My design needed give content and function priority - the design needed to support and not distract from the purpose of the site. My ultimate goal was to surprise and provide a fun experience for the viewer without overwhelming them.
